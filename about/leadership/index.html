As a floor representative, I participated in hall government meetings, which involved collaborating with other floor reps to plan hall events and voting on funding requests.  In October, I was named Wolf of the Week, an award for citizenship in which you get to take care of Snyphi Junior (pictured below) for a week.  During my time in hall government, I also organized a floor event.  In order to make the floor event a reality,  I had to prepare a presentation, create a budget, request funding, acquire materials, and supervise the event.  The event was a success with a total of 17 participants in attendance throughout the night, 5 more than expected.
